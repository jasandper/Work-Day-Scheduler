- Create a time block for each hour in the work day.  Add this code to html
- use CSS classes and ID's and incorporate them into html
- use moment.js and add the current day in the heading
- set each hour block background such that if it's in the past it's white, if it's in the present it's red and if it's in the future it's green.  We should find a moment.js method that will grab the current time hour in 24hr format this way when it's 11pm our calendar doesn't show present for the 11am block.  We can achieve this by creating a function with conditionals where if time is between 0 and 8 show all blocks as green for future, else if time is between  9 and 17 excecute code to change bakgrounds for the current day calednar, else if time is between 18 and 23 show all hour blocks with the Past background color.
- Allow text entered in each hour block to be stored in local storage after hitting the save button.  When we refresh the page the event should still be shown.
