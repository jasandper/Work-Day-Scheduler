- Create a time block for each hour in the work day.  Add this code to html
- use CSS classes and ID's and incorporate them into html
- use moment.js and add the current day in the heading
- set each hour block background such that if it's in the past it's white, if it's in the present it's red and if it's in the future it's green.
